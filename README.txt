sc8pr is a Python 3 package for educational programming. It aims to bring the
best features of Processing, Scratch, and robotics programming to Python, and
to make it easy for both new and experienced programmers to easily create
interactive animations and other graphics-based programs.

Features include:
* a simple framework for creating interactive animations
* image manipulation
* video effects / transitions
* sprite management
* physics-based collisions
* GUI

This is the development fork for sc8pr 2.0.
