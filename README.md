# Installation
The **scropr** package depends on [Pygame](http://pygame.org/download.shtml). Ensure that you have Pygame 1.9.1 or 1.9.2 installed for the Python version (3.2+) that you will be using.

As **scropr** is entirely Python 3 source code, no special installation is required. Simply ensure that the *scropr* folder is located somewhere in your PYTHONPATH (e.g. your source folder, or the *Lib/site-packages* folder of the Python installation.)
