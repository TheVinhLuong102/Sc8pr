# sc8pr

An educational programming package for [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org). Inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Processing](https://www.processing.org), sc8prâ€™s aim is to make it easy for new and experienced Python programmers to create animations, games, and other graphics-based programs.

sc8pr 2.0 features include:
* a simple, event-driven approach to creating interactive animations
* image manipulation
* sprite management
* physics-based collisions
* video effects / transitions
* a selection of GUI controls
* robotics simulator [experimental]

# Installation

```
pip3 install setuptools wheel
pip3 install https://github.com/dmaccarthy/sc8pr/archive/master.zip
```

If setuptools is unable to locate a Pygame wheel for your platform and Python version, you will need to install [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news) separately.
